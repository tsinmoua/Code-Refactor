* Taking the existing code provided to us from the homework in GitLab and refactor it to meet the standards.

* Links to GitHub Repo & Pages

* Things that went well were the alt tags to the images, combining lines in the CSS that had the same description of what they were trying to do, and getting rid of any styling that wasn't necessary for the page to look the same.
